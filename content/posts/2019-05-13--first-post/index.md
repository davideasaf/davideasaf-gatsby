Welcome to my first post!

This is my brand new website and i'm looking forward to writing great software engineering content that I've learned and am <strong>currently</strong> learning throughout my career. 

## Career
I grew up in the Bay Area in Northern California in a medium size city called Antioch, CA. I decided to attend college in South Carolina at a small university called Bob Jones University. I studied Bible and computer science (yes, I will definitely write about that small interesting fact!). My junior year I took an internship in northern Virginia as a web engineer at Booz Allen Hamilton and following graduation accepted a full-time position. During my time at Booz Allen, I started my masters in computer science by enrolling in the OMSCS program at Georgia Tech. I spent almost 2 years at Booz Allen before getting married and moving to Charlotte, NC. I took a position at Red Ventures as a Software engineer and spent 2 years there as well building partner integrations as well as front end customer facing and internal facing systems. After an incredible experience at Red Ventures, I decided I needed to challenge myself with a position that would expose me to machine learning and a chance at revolutionizing an industry. In February of 2019, I joined American Tire Distributor's Advanced Analytics team with an interest to learn more about integrating ML solutions to an industry that was ripe for disruption. I am loving the challenge!

## My Personal Life

I am married to my best friend Viridiana and have a goofball of a dog named Narcisse. Narcisse is a 70 lb. labradoodle who is way more flexible than any dog I've ever met. I come from Hispanic roots and yes that definitely means I love tacos. A few of my other interests are snowboarding, hiking, basketball, volleyball, woodworking, and board games.
